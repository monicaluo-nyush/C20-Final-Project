            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Art and history are intertwined as the story of people‚Äôs lives is what inspires art in the first place. As China experienced a turmoil period in the twentieth century of war, revolution, political transformations, and famine, the performing art scene in China produced many historically classic works in Chinese culture from compositions. These works were both a powerful tool for cultural expression and ideological messaging by being filled with embodiment of values, struggles, and aspirations of the time of both the people in China and the Chinese government. They shared not only the lives of ordinary citizens, but also aligned with narratives promoted by the state, producing art that was innovative and blended within socialist goals. Although we have only started the twenty-first century, the performing arts works and production from twentieth Century China still heavily influences the modern performing arts scene and production in China. Specifically, the ideas of making art materially accessible to the common masses, sparking romantic nationalism within socialist constraints, and the integration of Western and Chinese artistic techniques leading to art diplomacy. Through evaluating the works of the White Hair Girl Ballet and the Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto, representing twentieth century China, alongside modern Chinese performing art composition and production like Pengpeng Gong‚Äôs Peking Fantasy Symphony and China‚Äôs National Ballet Conservatory‚Äôs 2023 production of Dream of the Red Chambers Ballet, this essay traces how motifs of worked made in 20th Century China have both evolved and traveled through works created today in China.

            <p>Among the pioneers of Chinese-Western artistic fusion was He Luting, whose impact on music education still shapes China‚Äôs performing arts scene. Though he began the piano at 20‚Äîlater than most other composers‚Äîhe quickly rose to international prominence. His 1934 composition Cowherd‚Äôs Flute won first place in a competition judged by Russian composer Alexander Tcherepnine and was later featured in The Musical Quarterly as ‚Äúa piece of piano music with a Chinese flavor... an opportunity music lovers should not miss.‚Äù (Cai 125; Shenbao 1). He composed for the Communist Party in his youth and, after 1949, led the Shanghai Conservatory of Music (SHCM), his alma mater. There, he recruited foreign-trained faculty, launched a folk music department, and created divisions for younger students to access early music training. Though persecuted during the Cultural Revolution for his ties to Western music, he returned to SHCM after imprisonment and remained active in music education. ‚ÄúThe purpose of unlocking Western music techniques,‚Äù he wrote, ‚Äúis to expand our modern (Chinese) music culture‚Äù (He 56).
            </p>
            <p>As we start our journey, we give thanks to He‚Äôs quiet but lasting influence and presence. He was present and teaching during the 20th Century, like when The White-Haired Girl was first produced as an opera in Yan‚Äôan, He was in Yan‚Äôan as well. Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto was composed by two SHCM students under his leadership in 1959, and modern composers like Pengpeng Gong, trained at SHCM‚Äôs elementary school (Jiang 1). The blending of Chinese themes with Western formats‚Äîa cornerstone of He‚Äôs teaching‚Äîremains vital in Chinese composition today. (Cheng)

            </figure>
            <p>The earliest version of White Hair Girl was a folk tale from Shaanxi province, passed down through oral tradition. When the Communist Party settled in Yan‚Äôan in the 1940s, the story resonated with Party members and became one of the first successful plays created there under Communist influence. The story follows Xi‚Äôer, the daughter of a poor peasant. When her father couldn't repay his debt, a cruel landlord took Xi‚Äôer as payment. Her father, overcome with shame, took his own life. In the landlord‚Äôs home, Xi‚Äôer was abused and raped. When the landlord grew bored of her and arranged to sell her into prostitution, Xi‚Äôer discovered she was pregnant and escaped into the mountains. In the opera version, she gives birth; in the ballet, she miscarries. Isolated and surviving on wild berries and temple offerings, Xi‚Äôer‚Äôs hair turns white from malnutrition, and local villagers begin mistaking her for a goddess. Eventually, her former lover returns with the Eighth Route Army, liberates the village, and avenges her suffering (Qi 4).
            </p>
            <p>While the core plot has remained stable, White Hair Girl has continually evolved in medium, detail, and purpose. In 1945, during the play‚Äôs development in Yan‚Äôan, Mao Zedong personally suggested ending with the landlord being shot‚Äîa change that shaped later versions for decades (Cai 169). The 1950s brought multiple film adaptations with varying plot details. The first ballet version was choreographed by Japan‚Äôs Matsuyama Ballet Troupe, invited by Zhou Enlai to perform in China in 1955 and 1958 (Qi 7). Inspired by this, the Shanghai Dance School staged its own version in 1963. Under Jiang Qing, Mao‚Äôs wife and head of cultural policy during the Cultural Revolution, the ballet became one of the Eight Model Operas. It served both to spread Communist values domestically and as a diplomatic tool. Visiting dignitaries watched the ballet as part of formal visits, and the Shanghai Dance School toured internationally to perform it (Wilkinson 174). Today, the ballet is mostly revived during national holidays and anniversaries of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) milestones (Qi 12).
            </p>
            <p>Foreign reviews of the ballet were less favorable than domestic ones. R.G. Davis, reviewing the 1973 film version, wrote, ‚ÄúThe simplification of the ballet and the clumsiness of the camera combine to produce neither a ballet story nor a filmic story, but rather a programmatic series of images‚Ä¶ Mao said: ‚ÄòLearn from the old and incorporate in the new.‚Äô But‚Ä¶ this does not seem to be what has been happening‚Äù (3). Foreign critics held the production to high artistic standards, which were not fully met. In contrast, White Hair Girl was a sensation in 1945, with Derk Bodde noting, ‚ÄúThough slated to close tomorrow, it could easily run for an additional month, judging from the capacity houses‚Ä¶ overwhelming proof of the strength of the new ideas in revolutionary China‚Äù (Wilkinson 174).
            </p>
            <p>One of the central motifs of White Hair Girl is ‚Äúart for the masses‚Äù‚Äîa concept that bridged pre- and post-1949 Communist art. Before the PRC‚Äôs founding, artists like composer He Luting traveled with skit troupes to perform operas for common people (He 31‚Äì33). After 1949, this mass-oriented approach continued under Jiang Qing‚Äôs oversight through the Eight Model Operas. These works, whether operas or ballets, were chosen for their accessibility and ability to be staged widely. The rural setting of White Hair Girl, mirroring the lived experiences of many Chinese in the 1930s and ‚Äô40s, made it especially relatable. Even though ballet is a Western form, the emotional narrative and folk themes helped bridge that cultural gap. Audience feedback often led to revisions, making the piece more resonant and ideologically adaptive over time. (Qi 11) These updates kept the story aligned with the CCP‚Äôs shifting goals and values for each generation.
            </p>
            <p>The story of the White Hair Girl also shaped the memories of many people in China, from those alive at Yan‚Äôan to the current adults alive in China, making it a cultural part of the Chinese identity, supporting an idea called romantic nationalism within socialist constraints‚Äìbalancing the emotional pull of cultural pride with political or ideological demands of a socialist or modern socialist society. The plot romanticized rural China of the peasants, the endurance of common people, and their ability to survive in injustice, allowing the peasants to be framed as heroes of national spirit-proud, strong, and dignified despite all the suffering. The use of music is highly emotional, with folk melodies, sorrow tunes, and the setting of rural life to stir the cultural pride of our recent ancestors. At the same time, the story of White Hair Girl was heavily promoted as one of the Eight Model Operas by Jiang Qing with the goals of spreading messages in line with how the landlord system is evil, the CCP is the savior, suffering alone is not the end point as all must be liberated by the collective force of revolution, leading to the ideas that only the revolutionary future is truly celebrated. The emotional connection to China‚Äôs folk spirit is encouraged, but also immediately tied to the ideological necessity of revolution. 
            </p>
            <p>Another key theme is the integration of Western artistic techniques. Ballet and Western orchestration‚Äîfeaturing instruments like piano, violin, cello, and trombone‚Äîwere used to convey Chinese stories to both domestic and international audiences. While early productions may have seemed artistically undeveloped, their use of familiar forms made the works more accessible and exportable. The Shanghai Ballet became one of the first troupes sent abroad to perform Chinese ballet works like White Hair Girl, launching what scholars term a ‚Äúsecond wave‚Äù of ballet diplomacy. For instance, in 1974, the University of Michigan staged its own production inspired by the Chinese version (Davis 174). The ‚Äúfirst wave‚Äù began in the 1950s, when Premier Zhou invited the Japanese Dance Group to perform their own adaptation in Beijing, which helped lay the groundwork for improved Sino-Japanese relations (Qi 11). These exchanges show how artistic forms like White Hair Girl not only marked cultural milestones, but also helped build national identity and international influence through art by using a western art form to represent a Chinese story.

            <h2>Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto</h2>
            <p>üîä Now playing Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto composed by Cheng Gang and He Zhanhao </p>
            <p>Inspired by the Chinese folktale of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai, widely known as the ‚ÄúChinese Romeo and Juliet,‚Äù the Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto is a musical reimagination of this tragic love story. Composed in 1959 by Chen Gang and He Zhanhao, then students at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, the concerto integrates Chinese folk elements with a contemporary symphonic style that remains widely performed today. Set in the Jin Dynasty, the tale follows Zhu Yingtai, who disguises herself as a man to pursue education, and her classmate Liang Shanbo, with whom she falls in love. When she returns home, Zhu hints at her identity by suggesting Liang marry her fictitious "sister." Upon visiting her, Liang discovers the truth‚Äîbut Zhu‚Äôs parents have already arranged her marriage to another. Heartbroken, Liang dies of sorrow. On her wedding day, Zhu mourns at his grave, and in a moment of divine sympathy, the tomb opens. She leaps in, and the two are transformed into butterflies, flying away together in eternal freedom (Chao 7‚Äì9). Originally written for violin, the piece has since been transcribed for various instruments including erhu, pipa, guzheng, guitar, and double bass, reflecting its broad cultural appeal and adaptability.
            </p>
            <p>According to He Zhanhao in Rhapsody in Red‚ÄØ: How Western Classical Music Became Chinese by Sheila Melvin and Jingdong Cai, the concerto initially received mixed reviews: ‚ÄúOf course, not everyone liked it as some considered its way of harmonizing Chinese melodies to be too simple and sentimental while some leftists decried the use of the ‚Äòfeudal‚Äô legend as inspiration.‚Äù Nonetheless, the public embraced it, and it has since become a staple of Chinese orchestras and a fixture on international stages (Cai 210‚Äì211). During the Cultural Revolution, however, the piece was banned for allegedly making laborers ‚Äútoo weak to work with machines‚Äù after listening to it (Cai 256). Despite the ban, it lived on in the Chinese diaspora: ‚ÄúPeople still tried to listen to it secretly or stored it very carefully and performed it outside the country such as in Hong Kong. The concerto has never fallen‚Äù (Chao 13). As the concerto is based on a widely known folk tale, it resonates emotionally with many Chinese audiences. Its strong melodic roots in Chinese folk music help make it accessible even to those unfamiliar with Western classical music. During the Hundred Flowers Campaign‚Äîa brief period in the late 1950s that encouraged artistic openness‚Äîthe concerto exemplified efforts to create art that was popular, nationalistic, and emotionally direct. By translating a traditional story into a Western symphonic form, the Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto invited everyday Chinese citizens into concert halls, making classical music feel both familiar and national.
            </p>
            <p>The concerto also represents a unique moment of romantic nationalism within the constraints of socialism. Composed during a time of relative ideological leniency, the work promoted national pride through cultural heritage while avoiding overt political critique. The violin is used to imitate traditional instruments such as the erhu and guzheng, highlighting the piece‚Äôs deep ties to Chinese musical identity. At the same time, the love story‚Äôs themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and defiance in the face of social constraints align subtly with state narratives without directly opposing them. The fate of the piece during the Cultural Revolution demonstrates the shifting boundaries of acceptable art in 20th-century China. Once banned for being too Western and sentimental, the concerto‚Äôs repression reflected the period's ideological rigidity, when even emotional expression could be considered counter-revolutionary. Yet today, the Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto has been rehabilitated and embraced, aligning with modern state ideals of promoting traditional Chinese culture in modern forms.</p>
            <p>While banned in mainland China, the concerto found life abroad. It was performed in places like Hong Kong, becoming an early example of arts diplomacy. Today, it is performed internationally by both Chinese and Western orchestras and musicians. Its adaptability‚Äîbeing arranged for instruments ranging from the saxophone to the pipa‚Äîunderscores its cultural flexibility and cross-cultural appeal. Chao observes that the piece‚Äôs structure reflects Western sonata form‚Äîexposition, development, and recapitulation‚Äîmirroring the story‚Äôs progression of love, rebellion, and transfiguration (Chao 36). This fusion enables Western audiences to appreciate the narrative within a familiar format, while Chinese listeners connect with the traditional story and musical elements. The concerto sounds unmistakably Chinese due to three key aesthetic techniques: adapting tempo markings from folk opera, using the pentatonic ‚Äúchih‚Äù mode (ÂæÅË∞ÉÂºè), and employing traditional performance methods like glissandi inspired by the erhu (Chao 37, 63‚Äì64). These choices allow a Western instrument to express Chinese timbres and emotions, making the piece feel inherently Chinese even when performed by international artists. For many in the general public without formal musical training, the piece‚Äôs melodies are instantly recognizable as Chinese. In essence, the Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto is more than a musical composition‚Äîit is a cultural ambassador. It bridges Western and Chinese musical traditions, asserts China‚Äôs artistic identity on the world stage, and reflects the complex relationship between artistic expression and state ideology throughout modern Chinese history. Through both its resilience and resonance, it remains a powerful symbol of China‚Äôs evolving cultural diplomacy and national identity.

                </figcaption>
            </figure>
           <p>One of the most renowned novels in Chinese literature, Dream of the Red Chambers‚Äîalso known as Dream of the Red Mansion or The Story of the Stone ‚Äîwas written by Cao Xueqin in the 18th century during the Qing Dynasty. It consists of 120 chapters, with the first 80 circulated as hand-copied manuscripts. However, much scholarly debate surrounds the final 40 chapters, as inconsistencies in style and detail have led some to question whether they were fully authored by Cao himself. This richly detailed narrative has been adapted and reinterpreted in numerous forms over the past century‚Äîincluding operas, both Chinese and Western, films, television series, and most recently, a ballet produced by China‚Äôs National Ballet. (Zhang 2-6) In February 2023, the Central Ballet of China premiered its first version of Dream of the Red Chamber in Beijing. Following its initial reception, the ballet was revised and re-premiered in September 2023, incorporating suggestions from both the public and academic experts. (China Writer 1) Given that the original novel features over 100 characters and immense narrative detail‚Äîso much so that an entire field of academic study, known as ‚ÄúRedology,‚Äù is devoted to its analysis (Zhang 4)‚Äîadapting the story for the performing arts is a remarkable feat. The ballet adaptation has resonated with audiences in China and across the Chinese diaspora. For instance, the Chinese Embassy in France announced that the filmed version of the ballet would be screened in French theaters, marking an effort to share Chinese culture globally (Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the French Republic 1). Likewise, the international influence of the story was evident in a $3 million co-production by the San Francisco Opera and the Hong Kong Arts Festival in 2016. (Zhang 4) </p>
           <p>The plot of Dream of the Red Chamber unfolds within the dream of a monk and centers around Jia Baoyu, a young man born with a magical jade stone into a wealthy and prestigious aristocratic family. Baoyu is torn between two women: Lin Daiyu, his sensitive and poetic cousin with whom he shares a profound, tragic bond; and Xue Baochai, who is kind, pragmatic, and deemed a more socially acceptable match. As the story progresses, Baoyu grapples with familial pressures and personal desires, set against the backdrop of his family‚Äôs gradual decline due to internal corruption, political downfall, and moral decay. Daiyu‚Äôs death and Baoyu‚Äôs forced marriage to Baochai mark a turning point. Ultimately, Baoyu abandons worldly attachments and chooses the path of spiritual retreat as a monk. The story delivers a poignant meditation on the fragility of dreams, the impermanence of wealth and status, and the emotional turmoil that arises from social constraints. (San Francisco Opera 1)
           </p>
           <p>The paths of both The White-Haired Girl and Dream of the Red Chamber are similar: both began as literary stories and were later adapted into operas, television shows, and films. Notably, the first ballet version of Dream of the Red Chamber was produced not by a mainland Chinese company, but by the Hong Kong Ballet (Nan 1), before a Chinese dance troupe officially staged its own version. Like The White-Haired Girl, this production embraced the idea of art for the masses. The creative team incorporated feedback from both government officials and general audiences, resulting in 60 revisions within the first seven months (China Writer 1). These changes aimed to remain faithful to the original text while making the performance more engaging and relatable to a wider audience. By choosing such a well-known and nationally cherished story, the production attracted even those who might not usually attend the ballet. While Dream of the Red Chamber avoids overt ideological messaging, it still subtly reinforces socialist values through its portrayal of aristocratic decline and the suffering of ‚Äúgood‚Äù characters under corrupt systems. The ballet becomes both accessible and ideologically aligned, shaped by the people and yet guiding them toward state-approved ideals.
           </p>
           <p>When you watch for the details in the Dream of the Red Chambers ballet, aside from the awe you will get form its spectacular costumes and set, the choice of flowy Hanfu like dresses visually situates the work as a uniquely Chinese cultural lineage (MEZZO) By romanticising a shared past of the dynasties in history, it evokes an emotion for Chinese citizens about the Chinese identity closely related to details, like attire, and the shared experience of reading, watching, and understanding the famous novel of Dream of the Red Chambers. At the same time, the beautiful use of traditional Chinese clothes signals to an international audience the sophistication and beauty of ancient Chinese culture. The story of the Dream of the Red Chambers is iconic and pinnacle in Chinese traditional literature, by turning into a more modern art form of ballet, it reclaims a piece of cultural heritage as it uplifts the emotional Chinese memory with grand stylization to retell the story. At the same time, the choice of the Dream of the Red Chambers still shows signs of promoting modern CCP values. Within the plot of the Dream of the Red Chambers, the fall of the Jia family can be seen as a symbol parallel to the end of feudalism, in which the character‚Äôs personal desires are subordinated to a larger social force, which mirrors collectivist ethos that are promoted under socialism. The ballet emulates another modern value of the Communist Party, the positive promotion of Chinese culture and history. As the novel is historical, showcasing ancient Chinese culture that is still celebrated today and a precursor of modern Chinese culture. 
           </p>
           <p>Ballets like White Hair Girl and The Red Detachment of Women from the 1960s set a precedent for using Western artistic forms to tell Chinese stories. This legacy continues in productions like Dream of the Red Chamber, which both localize ballet and expand its expressive capacity. Though ballet is traditionally a Western form, its integration with Chinese narrative, music, and costume in this production transforms it into something distinctly Chinese. It not only retains the technical rigor of classical ballet but also embodies a hybrid art form reflective of China‚Äôs modern cultural identity. In 2024, the Chinese Embassy in France began promoting the filmed version of the ballet in French cinemas, an effort that enhances China‚Äôs cultural diplomacy. While Dream of the Red Chamber has not yet achieved the same diplomatic prominence as The White-Haired Girl, it demonstrates considerable potential. Earlier opera adaptations by Bright Sheng‚Äîcommissioned by the San Francisco Opera and staged in both China and the U.S. in 2016 and 2022‚Äîset a precedent for international reception. With continued performances and strategic cultural promotion, the ballet version may yet become a significant soft power tool for advancing Chinese cultural narratives abroad.

            <p>Premiered on January 30, 2019, in Philadelphia in celebration of 40 years of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, the Shanghai Philharmonic Orchestra and the Philadelphia Orchestra commissioned Peng-Peng Gong to write his 10th Symphony, Peking Fantasy. Taking motifs and sounds from Peking Opera, but written for an orchestra using only instruments traditionally seen as Western, Peking Fantasy is a modern continuation of He Luting‚Äôs teachings on using Western techniques to further Chinese musical expression. In an interview with The Violin Channel prior to the premiere, Gong expressed his hope that this composition could serve as ‚Äúa little window into its themes and spark interest in this unique art form‚Äù (The Violin Channel 1).
            </p>
            <p>To understand why Peng-Peng Gong was selected for this diplomatic celebration, we must look at his background. Gong is a Chinese-born, Western-educated composer known for his tonal and neo-romantic style. After twelve years of study, he graduated from Juilliard in 2014 as both a pianist and composer, and has since served as Resident Composer of the Shanghai Philharmonic Orchestra. By the age of 33, he had already composed ten symphonies, a viola concerto, and three piano concertos‚Äîa remarkable achievement for someone his age (The Violin Channel 1; Jiang 1). He is one of China‚Äôs most prominent living composers and has reflected his bicultural experience through works such as Symphony No. 6 and the condensed version, A Chinese in New York, inspired by his time in New York City (The Violin Channel 1).
            </p>
            <p>Reception of the symphony has been mixed. According to Yue Cheng, the current Area Head of NYU Shanghai‚Äôs Performing Arts Program, an alumnus of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music Middle School opened by He Luting, and a former Principal Oboist of the Shanghai Philharmonic who performed in the Peking Fantasy premiere: ‚ÄúWell liked by the government, but the musicians hated it‚Äù (Cheng). While Cheng acknowledges Gong‚Äôs technical talent, he notes that many in the orchestra felt the piece was composed primarily to align with the preferences of the Chinese Ministry of Propaganda. For audiences without classical training, the use of Chinese pentatonic scales and famous Peking Opera melodies makes the piece feel authentically Chinese. However, for trained Chinese musicians familiar with Western orchestral traditions, the work felt like a Western symphony dressed in Chinese motifs‚Äîwhat Cheng described as ‚Äúa Chinese cover...over a Western composition‚Äù (Cheng).
            </p>
            <p>Cheng offers a historical perspective on why compositions like Peking Fantasy resonate with Chinese audiences. During our interview, he explained that Western-style composition became more palatable in China than folk music, which ‚Äúremained a form of entertainment and never developed into an art like Western art...maybe because of that, it's easier for Chinese to tune their ears to Western music and arts‚Äù (Cheng). People who grew up during the 1970s and 1980s often had limited access to cultural productions beyond the Eight Model Operas, and among them, the two most iconic works were ballets infused with Western techniques and orchestration. In this context, Peking Fantasy draws on familiar Chinese cultural references (like Peking Opera) in a symphonic format accessible to modern Chinese audiences‚Äîmost of whom, as Cheng observed, were ethnically Chinese. With a historically more palatable orchestration style by a Chinese composer, this piece welcomes many, especially of Chinese descent, into the concert halls as they listen to a familiar way of art with even more familiar audio motifs from Peking opera. 
            </p>
            <p>Despite lacking a narrative arc or overt political message, Peking Fantasy aligns with ideological values promoted by the modern Chinese Communist Party under Xi Jinping. In a 2016 speech at the 10th National Congress of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Xi stated: ‚ÄúWe hope to create excellent works that embody the essence of the Chinese culture, reflect the Chinese people's aesthetic pursuits, spread the values of contemporary China, and are in line with the world's progressive trends‚Äù (1). Gong‚Äôs piece reflects this goal. By weaving Peking Opera elements into a Western symphonic structure, it pays tribute to Chinese heritage while demonstrating China‚Äôs capacity for high-level artistic production in global formats. As Cheng noted, Gong is ‚Äúvery successful in getting government grants‚Äù because ‚Äúhe fixed a lot of his energy and creativity on pleasing the [China‚Äôs] Ministry of Propaganda, as a lot of [his compositions] fit into contemporary party slogans‚Äù (Cheng).
            </p>
            <p>Gong‚Äôs composition continues the legacy of He Luting, who advocated for music that sounded Chinese but used Western forms. Like the Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto, Peking Fantasy incorporates Chinese pentatonic melodies within Western compositional structures. This makes the piece more exportable and easier to perform internationally‚Äîsomething Cheng highlighted when recalling the orchestra‚Äôs trip to Philadelphia: the musicians did not need special instruments or equipment because of the Western orchestral format. The piece has also been performed at venues like Carnegie Hall, notably by the Bard Conservatory of Music in the ‚ÄúChina Now‚Äù festival in 2024, (The Violin Channel 1) again demonstrating its adaptability to Western concert settings. This adaptability is key to the work‚Äôs diplomatic function. As a piece created to commemorate four decades of U.S.-China relations, Peking Fantasy exemplifies arts diplomacy. By blending national pride with international appeal, the piece operates as a soft power tool that builds cultural understanding through a non-verbal and emotionally resonant medium.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p> üîä Now playing Peng-Peng Gong's Viola Concerto Performed by soloist Liyuan Liu and the Shanghai Philharmonic Orchestra </p>
            <p>After starting our journey with the work of He Luting‚Äôs Cowherd Flute as one of the first internationally admired composition to be distinctly Chinese on a western instrument, to reviewing works from New China like the White Hair Girl ballet and Butterfly Lovers Violin Concerto, and the modern Chinese works of the Dream of the Red Chambers Ballet and Peking Fantasy Symphony, a complex narrative of how works from the last century China impact modern Chinese performing arts. All pieces share the motifs of how art was made for the masses, a representation of romantic nationalism within socialist constraints, and how the integration of Western arts techniques and Chinese elements led to diplomacy. Where revolutionary ideals, national identity, and artistic hybridity interwrines, these works which were once written to be charged with the mission of shaping people‚Äôs values are now used as tools to preserve and celebrate a part of China‚Äôs national cultural heritage. Given the strong similarities and influence of art from the last century, the transition can invoke a new question, what does it mean when revolutionary art becomes heritage? Do we free the political intent, the rendering of aesthetics rather than ideology, or does it continue to subtly reinforce the narrative that were once overtly promoted but now less contested and more palatable for both the Chinese and international audience? In a modern age, where China seeks to project soft power through global cultural diplomacy in a multifaceted way, the endurance of these works influence modern Chinese works suggest that art born out of revolution can outlive its original context. To not discard ideology, but to once again evolve the methods by focusing on symbols of cultural pride, artistic achievement and national continuity. The revolution echoes on, by not directly calling to action on the audience, but to remember and celebrate the cultural memory through art for the modern eyes, or as Xi Jingping named one of his speeches: ‚ÄúConfidence in Chinese Culture.‚Äù </p>

                    <p>AI Usage:
                        ChatGPT was used to code out this digital essay you are reading to link sections of my writing to music. My main prompt was ‚ÄúIf I use VS Code to host a digital essay, can you give me the JS, CSS, and HTML code to be able to input photos, and have 9 sections in my writing to link up to 9 different mp3 files. For the Audio experience, please have the music slightly fade in and out, as well as be able to continue playing the mp3 file in one section when I return to the section. Have the playing be smooth so when I scroll the mp3 file keeps playing. I want a start page as well with a start button and a button in the front. Have the background be a gradient red on the start page, and the background of the essay be a gradient of red, orange, yellow, but leave my last section white. Section 9 will be work cited, so please allow for hanging indents.‚Äù I repeatedly fed ChatGPT and Claude AI code and errors to have it fix the code it spit out so that it eventually works smoothly.
